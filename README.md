# WebGL-Fundamentals

WebGL from the ground up. No magic.

These are a set of articles that teach WebGL from basic principles. They are NOT old rehashed out of date OpenGL articles like many others on the net. They are entirely new, discarding the old out of date ideas and bringing you to a full understanding of what WebGL really is and how it really works.
